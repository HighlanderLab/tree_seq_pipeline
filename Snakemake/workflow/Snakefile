# all files should be in the vcfDir/RawVCF folder
# files that need spliting are named: Combined_something.vcf.gz
# files already separated by chr are named: Chr{n}_something.vcf.gz
# the script will identify and (1) split, if necessary,
# (2) sort into the correct Chr folder in vcfDir.

# defining variables that will be used throughout the script

# the final directory name is now editable -- so can be named according to specific project
# mapdir indicates where to find the genetic map for phasing (full path in the config)
mapdir = config['genmap']
oDir = Path(config['o_dir'], config['PROJECT'])

# the path where to save intermetdiate and final VCFs

    vcfOut = config['vcf_dir'] # same as above
else:
    vcfOut = f"{oDir}/VCF" # VCF dir inside the output dir


# this folder can be any where but must have the following structure:
# vcfDir:
#   - RawVCF
#   - Chr1
#   -Chr...


# if want to split multiallelic sites set to TRUE:
#multiallelic = False

chromosomes = [f'Chr{n}' for n in range(1, config['no_chromosomes'] + 1)]
# set a list of 'Chr' + chr# combinations to be used as wildcards
