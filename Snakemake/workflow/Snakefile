# the script will identify and (1) split, if necessary,
# (2) sort into the correct Chr folder in vcfDir.

# defining variables that will be used throughout the script

# the final directory name is now editable -- so can be named according to specific project
# mapdir indicates where to find the genetic map for phasing (full path in the config)

# this folder can be any where but must have the following structure:
# vcfDir:
#   - RawVCF
#   - Chr1
#   -Chr...

#multiallelic = False
